Road studs should be in the hard strip or kerb shyness width, with 50 mm setback from the median side edge line and 100 mm clearance from the raised kerb on Median Side Edge. Only 50 mm setback is required for Flushed or Depressed Medians; 100 mm clearance is not applicable. If space is insufficient, studs can be placed adjacent to or directly on the edge line. Road Studs with Anchorages is preferable for edge lines but not recommended for concrete roads. Proper installation is required to avoid pavement damage."}]}

Give Way Lines must be supplemented by a hollow triangular approach marking and a roadside sign, placed 2.5–12 m from the transverse marking. On two-way minor roads, the marking extends to the centerline, with a broken line for the remaining width. If needed, a continuous line can emphasize the major road’s kerb line. On major roads with paved shoulders, markings align with the shoulder edge for continuity. Roundabouts require Give Way markings and signs at entry points. Use Stop Marking and Stop Sign on minor roads at its intersecting point with a major road with restricted visibility, poor alignment, or high crash rates. If visibility is obstructed due to geometry, climate, or traffic, install a Stop Marking and Stop Sign. If visibility is clear in both directions, use a Give Way Marking and Give Way Sign on the minor road. On inter-urban and rural roads, Stop Markings and Stop Signs are preferred as they are more familiar to road users than Give Way Signs and Markings (as per clause 6.3)."}]}

They direct the exiting traffic into the proper angle for smooth movements of divergence. These markings provide for proper and safe use of deceleration lanes. The basic function is to inform the driver about the area/lane(s) which is set aside for the exclusive use of traffic on the main highway and thus enable the driver to adequately distinguish between through traffic lanes and the deceleration lanes. The spacing of chevron markings shall be 2 m for markings for less than 10 m (HM01), 4 m for markings 10 to 22 m marking (HM02) and 6 m for markings greater than 22 m (HM03). Wdith of chevron measures at right angles to the diagonals or chevrons is 600 mm. The total length of chevron markings depends on the lateral shift undertaken by a vehicle in motion and varies with site conditions and the length should be such that to accommodate at least two or three chevrons or diagonals. The diverging chevrons must always point towards approaching traffic. The gap between chevron and boundary line shall be 100 mm to facilitate drain of surface run off.
